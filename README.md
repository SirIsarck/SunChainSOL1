## SunChain

Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Solana

## Problem Statement

Millions of Africans lack reliable electricity.
Grid power is inconsistent, expensive, and centralized.
Rural communities depend on fuel generators that harm the environment.

## Our Solution — SunChain

A Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) connecting community solar hubs using Solana.

Each hub records energy data on-chain for transparency and trust.
Users pay via Solana smart contracts using stablecoins.

## Why Solana

Ultra-fast and low-cost micro energy payments

Real-time IoT data tracking via on-chain oracles

Scalable for millions of microgrid users


## How It Works

1. Communities install solar panels and IoT-enabled smart meters.


2. Energy data is transmitted to Solana and stored on-chain.


3. Users buy tokens or pay directly for electricity.


4. Revenue is distributed transparently among operators and investors.

## Impact

Provides clean and affordable power access

Creates new economic opportunities for rural tech operators

Demonstrates how blockchain can support real-world infrastructure

## Deployment & Usage

Requirements

Node.js version 18 or higher

Rust and Anchor framework installed

Solana CLI configured for devnet

## Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SirIsarck/SunChainSOL1.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd SunChainSOL1

# Install dependencies
npm install

## Deployment

# Build smart contracts
anchor build

# Deploy to Solana devnet
anchor deploy

## Usage

Connect a Solana wallet (Phantom or Solflare)

Register a community solar hub

Monitor real-time energy data

Execute payments and revenue sharing through the smart contract

## Technical Stack

Blockchain: Solana

Smart Contracts: Rust (Anchor Framework)

Frontend: React / Next.js

IoT Data: On-chain data + IPFS storage

Token: SPL token (SunToken)

## Security

On-chain verification of energy data

Escrow-based smart contracts for payment management

External smart contract audit planned before mainnet launch
