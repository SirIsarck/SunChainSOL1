# SunChain
SunChain ‚Äî Decentralized Solar Energy Network on Solana

## Problem Statement:

Millions of Africans lack reliable electricity.

Grid power is inconsistent, expensive, and centralized.

Rural communities depend on fuel generators that harm the environment.


## Our Solution ‚Äî SunChain:

A DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) connecting community solar hubs using Solana.

Each hub records energy data on-chain for transparency & trust.

Users pay via Solana smart contracts using stablecoins.


## Why Solana:

Ultra-fast & low-cost transactions for micro energy payments.

Real-time data tracking via on-chain oracles & IoT integration.

Scalable enough for millions of microgrid users.


## How It Works:

1. Communities install solar panels & smart IoT meters.


2. Data is sent to Solana and stored on-chain.


3. Users buy tokens or pay directly for electricity.


4. Transparent revenue distribution to maintainers & investors.


## Impact:

Access to clean, affordable power.

New economic opportunities for rural tech operators.

Proof that blockchain can power real-world infrastructure.


## Traction (Pilot):

10 solar units installed across 3 locations.

100+ users registered for pilot.

80%+ uptime, 70%+ success in data sync.


## Security Approach:

On-chain verification of energy data.

Escrow smart contracts for payments.

Plan to conduct external security audit before mainnet.
